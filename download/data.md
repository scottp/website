XCSoar works best if you provide it with some data files.
Supported are [Map](#terrain__topography), [Airspace](#airspaces) and 
[Waypoint](#waypoints) files, as well as the [FlarmNet database](#flarmnet) 
and a custom [Waypoint Details](#waypoint_details)  file. 

- Please download the data files suitable to your area 
- Copy them into the XCSoarData folder on your SD card  
  or a corresponding folder according to the [Manual](http://max.kellermann.name/download/xcsoar/releases/{{ site.xcsoar_stable_version }}/XCSoar-manual.pdf)
